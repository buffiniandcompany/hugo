Prioritization is the key to your productivity, and ultimately, to your success. These resources will help you establish a schedule for your lead generation activities on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.

**The Marketing Calendar** is used by our Coaches to help their clients schedule and track lead generation activities as far as a year in advance. Remember, you’re in the lead generation business so these activities should be given highest priority. This tool encourages you to get specific, so take some time to carefully plan your activities and you’ll start seeing the results of your efforts in no time!

Use the **Daily Schedule** sample as an example of how to make your lead generation activities your first priority and how to schedule in “wiggle room” to give yourself a back-up plan for the inevitable adjustments you’ll need to make or to use as a scheduled break in your day.
